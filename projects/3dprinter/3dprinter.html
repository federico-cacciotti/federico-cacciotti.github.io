    <p>In 2014, with a friend, I built a 3D printer, a Prusa i3 model, spending as little money as possible. Bought all the parts from internet and various tool shops, we assembled it and we started to do the first print tests. The machine has an Arduino MEGA with a Ramps 1.4 shield and has a geared extruder with a 0.4 mm nozzle.</p>

    <p>We became familiar with the machine and software (Repetier Host), after we started to make some changes to improove the printer. After a year we decided to spend some money and build a new 3D printer. Only at the end of 2015 I built the new 3D printer.</p>
    
    <p>The second printer, even it a Prusa i3, has an Arduino MEGA with a Ramps 1.4 and a 0.4 mm nozzle on a bowden extruder. Over time I improoved the machine: I laser cutted a new frame and I arranged all the parts in a more compact way. I also added a Raspberry Pi in order to have internet remote control and be able to control it with my smartphone through Repetier Server app.</p>
