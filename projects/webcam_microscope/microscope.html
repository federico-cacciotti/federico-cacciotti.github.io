    <h1>Webcam microscope</h1>
    <a href="/index.html">home page</a>
    
    <p>Using an old webcam I was able to do some interesting experiments. I tryed for example, to rotate the focusing optics, unscrewding it and fixing it upside down with hot glue. I noticed that approaching an object to the lenses, a zoomed image of it appears on the screen. I was exciting of that and I decided to build a 3D printed support to make better observations.</p>
    
    <p>The 3D printed support is composed by some layers: the base layer, the target positioning layer and the wabcam layer. Because of the small aperture of the lense I added a bright LED in order to light up the target. The two images below show a needle tip and an integrated circuit tracks: a single track has a diameter of few micrometers.</p>

    <p>I patiently designed a motorised focusing system with a floppy driver stepper motor and an Arduino. Unfortunately I broke the webcam (yeah, I am very careless...) and I haven't had yet the time to build a better microscope with a better cam.</p>
