    <h1>Simple spectroscope with a CD</h1>
    <a href="/index.html">home page</a>
    
    <p>A spectroscope, in this case "optical spectroscope", is an instrument used to study properties of matter like the composition. I briefly show you how it works. You maybe know that light (like the Sun light) is composed by a lot of colours, and different colours means different wavelengths. If a beam of Sun light passes through a prism, you will see a refracted pattern of colours that goes from red to violet, like a rainbow. This is a property of light: different colors (wavelengths) get refracted with a different angle, so the initial beam it's splitted in all it's components.</p>

    <p>Now if you consider a gas and give energy to it, it begins to emitt photons. These photons have only a specific energy and wavelength then the diffracted beam of this radiation will be not a continuous rainbow pattern but will be composed by a certain number of separated line. These lines are called <b>emission line</b> and form the so called <b>emission spectrum</b>. Every atom has a different emission spectrum (and in general every molecule). It's like Nature has a fingerprint for each atom.</p>
  
    <p>Exist also the <b>absorption lines</b>. An absorption line is produced when photons from a hot, broad spectrum source pass through a cold material. The intensity of light, over a narrow frequency range, is reduced due to absorption by the material. These lines looks like a "hole" in a continuous spectrum.</p>
    
    <p>The study of the emission and absorption lines allow us to determine the composition of the light source (like a star or a light bulb) or the composition of the medium in which light beam pass through.</p>
    
    <p>The spectroscope I built use the CD diffraction grating instead of a prism. The surface of a CD has many small pits in the plastic arranged in a spiral, a single pit has the size of about 1 micrometer, as you can see in the image below.</p>

    <p>This pattern reflect a light beam and split it into it's components. You can use a CD as a "light splitter" just after removing the reflective layer on it. You can do it with a piece of scotch tape: apply the tape on the reflective layer and quickly remove it.</p>
    
    <p>I glued the grating to one side of a paper tube of 5 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length. At the opposite side I made a very thin slit using two razor blades. Et voil√†, in this way I made a (rough) spectroscope. With my DSRL camera I can take some picture.</p>
    
    <p>The image below is a photo of a fluorescent light spectrum and the profile plot of the greyscale intensity obtained with ImageJ software.</p>

    The next image show the spectrum of the Sun, with the absorption lines well visible.

    In the following image I tried to photograph the emission lines of a neon lightbulb: the light of a neon lightbulb is very faint, so I made a long exposure (about 5 seconds of exposure) and this is the result.
