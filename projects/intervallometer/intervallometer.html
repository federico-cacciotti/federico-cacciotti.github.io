    <h1>Timelapse intervallometer</h1>
    
    <a href="/index.html">home page</a>
    <p>An intervallometer is a device that control how often, how long and how many shots are taken, usually with a reflex camera. It's used to make, for example, timelapses.</p>
    
    <p>I have a Canon EOS 600D. This camera doesn't have an internal intervallometer. I didn't want to buy an intervallometer, so I installed (at my own risk) a custom firmware with this function. After some tests I noticed that my camera run out of battery after just few hours, in other words, the intervallometer problems became a power supply problem and an external battery pack is so expensive. I had to find another solution.</p>
    
    <p>One day I decided to build an external intervallometer using an old and dusty ATmega328P forgotten in a drawer for months. With three seven-semgments display, some switch and two optocouplers I builted my own intervallometer. I also 3D printed the case.</p>
    
    <h3>Why optocouplers?</h3>
    <p>An optocoupler (or optoisolator) is an integrated circuit able to act as a "bridge" between the logic circuit and the camera. It's composed by an LED and a photosensor. When the microcontroller turns on the LED, the photosensor close the contact between the output wires: in this way the logic circuit is electrically isolated from the camera circuit. The answer is therefore: safety. A reflex camera is very expensive and apply random voltages to it isn't the best choice.</p>
    
    <p>This is the electric diagram of an optocoupler. You can find more informations on Google.</p>

    <p>This is a simple diagram of a camera jack pinout. With the image below as a reference: GND on the left, focus on the middle and shutter on the right.</p>

    <p>These are some of the timelapses I took.</p>
