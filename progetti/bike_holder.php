            <h1>Bike Holder</h1>
            <p>I realized this tool simply because it's more comfortable having less things in the pocket when you ride a bike. I searched a similar tool on the internet but I didn't find anything, so I decided to draw the model. You can mount it on a square section axe with a 35mm diameter, using two electrician straps. The support has a screw that allows you to change the phone inclination as you wish. The base you mount on your phone was glued on the support with epoxy and melting some plastic (in my case PLA) in the four holes with a welder.</p>
